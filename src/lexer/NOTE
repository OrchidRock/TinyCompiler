### Note
	The lexer haven't parser following statements better:
	1> id = id / id (lexer will report syntax error at '/'.)
	2> id.id() (lexer will parser '.' to "0.0",this is not the 
			result that we want.)
### solve
	I think that we can use to the input beffer to solve this 
	program.So ,we can rollback the current peak.
